    - It was required to create a web application that integrates with a database and demonstrates CRUD functionality.<br>
    - To host and deploy the application using containers <br>
    - To create CI/CD pipeline that will test, build and deploy the application. <br>


Any future improvements you would make.

You must use diagrams to illustrate your work as much as possible and opt for a succinct writing style. Examples of diagrams to include are:

    Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD).
    A full CI/CD pipeline diagram.
    An infrastructure diagram, illustrating the cloud resources and how they network together.
    A component-level diagram, illustrating how the application interfaces with the database.
